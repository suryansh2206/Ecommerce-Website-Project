        ReactJs is javascript framework developed by Facebook, Inc. react-js is
        a Javascript library for building user interfaces without writing any
        server side code. It works well with HTML and CSS. ReactJS is a
        JavaScript library designed to speed up web app development by providing
        a declarative alternative to traditional imperative programming. It
        provides a set of tools for building UI components that combine data and
        state using immutable data structures. Using these components, you build
        views layer by layer instead of directly manipulating the DOM. The core
        idea behind ReactJS is to create UI components that encapsulate their
        behavior and presentation. These components are reusable and testable.

        It’s easy to maintain them over time. You don’t need to worry about how
        they look on different browsers or devices. You can easily scale ReactJS
        applications across many servers. It’s fully compatible with the
        existing tooling like Webpack and Babel.
